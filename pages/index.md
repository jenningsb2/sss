**Now**: I am currently a *Lead Product Manager* at JobGet primarily working on [Snagajob](https://www.snagajob.com) products. Right now, I'm working to build the foundation of our applied AI infrastructure.

PMing in the applied AI space is changing by the minute, but I'm currently working with bleeding edge platforms such as Braintrust for prompt engineering, offline evals, and observability/tracing.

**Recently**: Before leading the foundational applied AI work, I was Snagajob's main B2B2C PM, overseeing all recruiter-facing product and integrations. I was responsible for the end-to-end job lifecycle from creation to search and discovery to application submission.

I'm a software product manager who creates high-craft products for real people facing real challenges. 

I lead with decisive action and clear communication, serving as both translator and bridge between departments.

My leadership balances ambitious vision with practical execution, helping teams produce elegant solutions to complex problems. I help champion ideas where designers and engineers can do their most ambitious work while maintaining a laser focus on what truly matters: *creating products that make users better at achieving their goals.*

My approach combines data literacy, design passion, and technical understanding to accelerate teams and organizations.


## Product philosophy

*Life is too short for bad software.* It's not enough to build a "good tool"â€”the tools we build should help people become better versions of themselves and assist them in making progress toward their own definition of [self actualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization).
